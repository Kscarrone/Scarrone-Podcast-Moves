## Serial Podcasts: The Alibi

The genre of podcasting that I selected could be referred to as news. I listened to The Alibi season one episode one which is produced by Serial Podcasts. This was the first podcast I listened to that I actually wanted to hear more about. The podcast followed a murder trial from 1999 in Baltimore county. The crime was committed eighteen years ago on January 13th 1999 so why was the speaker in this podcast series so intrigued with it I wondered? Hae Min Lee was murdered on this day and her ex-boyfriend Adnan was convicted of her murder but someone in this case is lying. Although, Adnan is convicted and in jail many people and stand by the claim that he is innocent and had nothing to do with Hae's strangulation and burial. However, a testimony on behalf of friend Jay was the testimony that was needed to put Adnan behind bars for life for first degree manslaughter. Jay claims that on that fateful day Adnan said he was going to kill Hae and that he strangled her to death and asked Jay to help bury her at a local park in a shallow grave. However, Adnan claims none of this ever happened but the problem is he doesn't have a solid alibi it only is twenty two minutes that Adnan doesn't remember because it was like any other day. The narrator of this podcast was approached by Adnan's family members to look into the case so she was directly approached for this role. However, this case is an enigma because the chief defense attorney in this case was later accused of purposely throwing cases in order to make more money but she passed away due to illness before she could be questioned again on the trial. The defense attorney for Adnan failed to include a key eye witness named Asia Mclean that said she saw Adnan at the public library right after school during those crucial twenty two minutes when Hae was murdered. Asia's testimony could have greatly influenced Adnan's trial and even proven his innocence but she was never contacted by the attorney. Despite, all the facts and Asia's potential eye witness testimony the question still remains who killed Hae Min Lee that day?

## Serial One: Episode 2- The Breakup

The second episode in the podcast series about the murder of Hae Min Lee orchestrated Serial. The jury claims that it was a crime of pride not a crime of love. The students from Woodland High School were a very close knit group. Hae Min Lee kept a diary about her relationship with Adnan. Prom night she wrote about Adnan she keeps falling deeper and deeper in love with him. Aiesha Pittman, Hae was her best friend and admits the relationship was secret so she would tell her parents she was at her friends house then hang out with Adnan. They both had immigrant parents so they understand the repercussions. They would page one another and then the call would come in from call waiting. Adnan showed up uninvited to an all girls trip at the amusement park. He'd often crash girls nights so that was overwhelming. A couple of times Hae called it off but then would ask for Adnan back. However, this podcast divulges the relationship between Adnan and Hae was just your average high school relationship.
